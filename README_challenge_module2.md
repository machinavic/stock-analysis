# **Module 2_VBA Excel Stock Analysis**

This module is intended to learn how to code VBA in Excel in order to automate through coding some operations. This particular case is about to handle a dataset containing stocks variables in order to deliver Total Daily Volume and Yearly return for each stock shown.

## **Overview of Project**

The project is compound by two parts, the first one involves coding refactoring with the aim to reduce the performance of the code initially worked on class; the second part is to deliver an explanation related to the analysis done throughout the entire project comparing the script time before refactoring and after doing it to check if streamlining this code worked or not.

## **Purpose**

In this particular case, Steve wanted me to prepare a macro where a button gives him the possibility to enter the "Year" he wants to analyze, and then show the Total volume and the Return for each ticker.
Using all the tools we learnt in class, the code performace was measured and saved as a .png on the "Resources" folder.


## **Analysis and Challenges**

During this exercise, the only challenge gotten was to apply the nested loops on the script wi the aim to compact the amount of written code. Also, I personally had some difficulties declaring the arrays but with some expalnation and google research I was able to finish the assignment.

Based on the performance gotten for 2017 and 2018 you can see the images here on this link:
